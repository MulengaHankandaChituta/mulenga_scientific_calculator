# Scientific Calculator

## Description:

This project is a Python-based scientific calculator, with a graphical user interface(GUI)built using the Tkinter library.The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations as well as scientific functions such as trigonometric functions, square root, exponentiation,logarithms and more.

## Features:

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition,subtraction,multiplication, and division.
- Trigonoometric functions:Sine, cosine, and tangent.
- Additional mathematical functions: Square root, logarithm(base 10), exponentiation.
- Evaluation of complex mathematical expressions.
- Clear button to reset the calculator
- responsive GUI design for ease of use.

## Ussage:

1. Ensure you have python installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository containing the scientific calculator code.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.
4. Run the `scientific_calculator.py` file using Python: `python3 scientific_calculator.py`.
5. The calulator GUI should appear, allowing you to perform various mathematical operations and functions.

## Instructions:

- To perform basic arithmetic operations, simply click the corresponding buttons('+','-','\*','/').
- For trigonometric functions, square root, logarithm, exponentiation, and other advanced operations, use the respective buttons labeled with the function names.
- You can enter complex mathematical expressions directly into the entry field, and the calculator will evaluate them when you press the '='button.

* To clear the entry field and start over, click the 'C' button.
